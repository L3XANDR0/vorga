The following are some notes taken for chapter 2:

Ch2 Project 5 - Calculate Discount Installment Loan

	Example:
		loan -> $1000
		interestRate -> 15%
		duration -> 18 months
		
		interest	= loan * interestRate * duration
				 	= 1000 * .15 * 18/12
				 	= $225 
				 	
	 	money2Consumer	= loan - interest
	 					= 1000 - 225
	 					= $775
 					
	Want:
		program inputs: amount consumer needs (money2Consumer), interest rate, and duration of loan in months
		
		program outputs: face value calculation (money2Consumer + interest) and monthly payments on face value loan
		
	Algoithm 1 (calculate face value):
		
		money2Consumer = loan - interest , we do not know the 'loan' variable ie face value, but other 2 var's are known
		
		money2Consumer = loan - (loan * interestRate * duration) , substitute 'interest'
		
		money2Consumer = loan * ( 1 - interestRate * duration )
		
		loan = money2Consumer / ( 1 - interestRate * duration )
		
	Algorithm 2 (calculate monthly payments):
		
		monthlyPayments = loan / duration
